# Projet-Artefact-actualit√©

This project is a student project backed by the french data consulting company Artefact, aiming at the creation of an
archivist bot. This bot will be able to suggest archive articles related to recent news to the end user, based on a
matching algorithm leveraging the latest technologies in Natural Language processing.

## Prerequisites: 
- We use the jupytext module to simplify version control of jupyter notebooks, which allows easy conversions between notebooks
and python files.
install : `pip install jupytext`

## Directory structure:

App : main directory for the chatbot app
data_collection : usefull scripts for fetching articles from gallica

All data should be stored on the computer using the following hierarchy : 

```
.
|-data
  |-articles
    |-yyyy (year)
      |-dd_mm_yyyy.json (issue of the day)

```

## Collecting new articles:

the data folder contains a cli tool `gallica.py` that allows to fetch new articles from the Gallica website and store them in 
the data directory. This tool provides two functionalities : 
- search : gives the reference and some informations given a periodic title
- retrieve : fetch articles from a given periodic, and process them before storing them in the data directory
for more info about this tool run `python gallica.py --help`
